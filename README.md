This project automates the process of job searching by leveraging Python and the OpenAI API (ChatGPT) together with the free LinkedIn API. The LinkedIn API used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/username/linkedin-api-project). It scrapes job postings from LinkedIn, categorises them based on your specific criteria, and emails the results daily.


## Features

- Sends a HTML report via email with categorised job listings.
